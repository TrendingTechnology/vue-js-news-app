# Basic Vue JS App

## In Development

### What's it do?
Builds a simple [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) app.

## Setup
Setup and use requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node JS (8.X.X or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a text editor such as
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing the required software listed in Setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-jarrett/basic-vue-js-web-app.git
cd basic-vue-js-web-app
npm install
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
npm install
```

Lint code
```bash
npm run lint
```

Linting code and fix most errors
```bash
npm run lint-and-fix
```

Runs Continuous Integration (linting and tests)
```bash

```

Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build

Build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
```bash
npm run build --report

```bash
