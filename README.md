# Basic Vue JS App

### What's it do?
Builds a simple [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) app.

## Setup
Setup and use requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node JS (8.X.X or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a text editor such as
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing the required software listed in Setup.
```
git clone https://github.com/matt-jarrett/basic-vue-js-web-app.git
cd basic-vue-js-web-app
npm install
```

### Usage
Lint the code. Frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain
style guidelines.
```
npm run lint
```
